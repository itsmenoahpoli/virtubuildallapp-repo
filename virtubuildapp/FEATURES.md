# Thesis Codebase: VirtuBuild

This codebase is for the application VirtuBuild.

## What is VirtuBuild?

VirtuBuild is an educational support tool that enables both instructors and students to learn about PC Assembly and Disassembly through the virtual space. The application is a 2D-isometric simulation of PC Assembly and Disassembly, focusing on 3 core modules for virtual laboratory tasks. Other than the laboratory activities, there are 3 quizzes that can be taken, one after each module laboratory activity. These quizzes can be created by the instructor and there are only multiple question choices.

## What does this all mean?

- Professors have more access to the system than students do
  - They can create quizzes
  - They can deploy laboratory activities
