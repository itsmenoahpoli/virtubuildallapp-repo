## Frontend Dashboard Analysis Prompt

**Analyze the existing VirtuBuild frontend dashboard and create a comprehensive checklist of what still needs to be implemented to align with the backend APIs and database structure.**

### **Instructions:**

1. **Examine the current frontend structure** in `virtubuildapp/src/app/features/` and identify what components are already implemented.

2. **Compare with backend capabilities** and create a detailed checklist of missing features organized by:

   **A. Admin Dashboard Features:**
   - Dashboard statistics and analytics
   - User management (CRUD operations)
   - User role management
   - Module management
   - Lab activity management
   - Assessment creation and management
   - Grade management
   - Performance analytics
   - Student group management
   - Module activation management
   - System settings
   - Audit log viewing

   **B. Instructor Dashboard Features:**
   - Student management
   - Module deployment
   - Assessment creation
   - Grade viewing and management
   - Student progress monitoring
   - Analytics and reporting

   **C. Student Dashboard Features:**
   - Module access and navigation
   - Lab activity execution
   - Assessment taking
   - Progress tracking
   - Grade viewing
   - Gamification elements
   - Analytics and performance metrics

   **D. Authentication & Security:**
   - Role-based access control
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Password reset functionality
   - Session management

   **E. System Features:**
   - Notifications system
   - Real-time updates
   - Data export capabilities
   - Mobile responsiveness

3. **For each missing feature, specify:**
   - Feature name and description
   - Required API endpoints
   - UI components needed
   - Data models required
   - Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
   - Estimated complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex)

4. **Identify integration gaps:**
   - Missing API service calls
   - Incomplete data models
   - Missing error handling
   - Authentication/authorization gaps

5. **Provide implementation recommendations:**
   - Suggested component structure
   - State management approach
   - UI/UX considerations
   - Testing requirements

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive checklist with 50+ items organized by category, with clear descriptions, priorities, and implementation guidance for each missing feature.

**Focus Areas:**
- Complete admin panel functionality
- Comprehensive instructor tools
- Enhanced student experience
- Robust authentication system
- Analytics and reporting
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error handling and validation

This analysis will help identify the gaps between the current frontend implementation and the full backend capabilities, providing a roadmap for completing the VirtuBuild application.
