# VirtuBuild Missing Features Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Working)
- Authentication & Role-based access control
- Basic CRUD operations for all entities
- Student grade viewing (own grades)
- Student analytics viewing (own analytics)
- Instructor module activation for groups
- Instructor grade viewing per activity
- Instructor assessment creation
- Admin dashboard and management

### ❌ MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES

## 1. Student Group Management
**Missing:** Student group assignment and management
**Impact:** Students can't be assigned to specific groups for module activations
**Required Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/student-groups` - Create student group
- `GET /api/student-groups` - List all groups
- `POST /api/student-groups/:groupId/students/:studentId` - Assign student to group
- `DELETE /api/student-groups/:groupId/students/:studentId` - Remove student from group

## 2. Student Assigned Content Access
**Missing:** Students can see all modules/activities instead of only assigned ones
**Impact:** Students see content they shouldn't have access to
**Required Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/students/assigned-modules` - Get student's assigned modules
- `GET /api/students/assigned-activities` - Get student's assigned activities
- `GET /api/students/progress` - Get student's progress tracking

## 3. Student Progress Tracking
**Missing:** No system to track student completion status
**Impact:** Can't track which students completed which activities
**Required Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/student-progress` - Submit activity completion
- `GET /api/student-progress/me` - Get student's progress
- `GET /api/student-progress/activity/:activityId` - Get progress for specific activity

## 4. Instructor Student Management
**Missing:** Instructors can't see student progress or manage student groups
**Impact:** Instructors can't track student performance effectively
**Required Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/instructors/students` - Get all students
- `GET /api/instructors/student-groups` - Get all student groups
- `GET /api/instructors/student-progress` - Get student progress overview
- `GET /api/instructors/student-analytics` - Get student performance analytics

## 5. Laboratory Activity Simulation
**Missing:** No API endpoints for virtual PC assembly simulation
**Impact:** Core functionality of VirtuBuild is missing
**Required Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/simulations/start` - Start PC assembly simulation
- `POST /api/simulations/:id/components` - Place component in simulation
- `GET /api/simulations/:id/state` - Get current simulation state
- `POST /api/simulations/:id/complete` - Complete simulation
- `GET /api/simulations/:id/score` - Get simulation score

## 6. Gamification System
**Missing:** No points, badges, or progress tracking
**Impact:** No motivation system for students
**Required Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/gamification/points/me` - Get student's points
- `GET /api/gamification/badges/me` - Get student's badges
- `GET /api/gamification/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard
- `POST /api/gamification/award` - Award points/badges

## 7. Module Prerequisites
**Missing:** No system for module dependencies
**Impact:** Students can access advanced modules without prerequisites
**Required Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/modules/:id/prerequisites` - Get module prerequisites
- `GET /api/modules/:id/available` - Check if module is available for student

## 8. Assessment Submission
**Missing:** No way for students to submit assessment answers
**Impact:** Post-lab assessments can't be completed
**Required Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/assessments/:id/submit` - Submit assessment answers
- `GET /api/assessments/:id/results` - Get assessment results
- `GET /api/assessments/me` - Get student's assessment history

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1 (Critical - Student Experience)
1. Student group management
2. Student assigned content access
3. Student progress tracking
4. Assessment submission
